* libclang_bindings
** Description
   This package consists of raw [[https://nim-lang.org][Nim]] bindings to [[https://clang.llvm.org/docs/Tooling.html][LibClang]]. It completely covers
   the [[https://clang.llvm.org/doxygen/group__CINDEX.html][C interface]] but provides nothing higher level, it is intended as a base
   package on which to build more convenient abstractions.

   It has been tested against the [[https://clang.llvm.org/docs/Tooling.html][LibClang]] bundled with [[https://clang.llvm.org/docs/Tooling.html][LLVM 9.0.0]], other versions may
   or may not work.

** Installation
   This is a [[https://github.com/nim-lang/nimble][Nimble]] package but must be installed via Git, so first clone this
   repo, then in the cloned directory do:
   #+begin_example
   > nimble install
   #+end_example
 
   If you need the Nim and Nimble toolchain [[https://github.com/dom96/choosenim][choosenim]] is the easiest way to get
   started.
